Android app that consumes a REST API to show a list with all the missions of ESA.

This was my project for the Lauzhack 2017 (a hackathon in Geneva, Switzerland).


Mainly, It had three components:
- A web scrapping system to extract data from the ESA (European Space Agency) website.
- A REST server to serve the data to the clients
- An actual android app to consume the data

It's a very (very basic) Android app, but was the first app I'd done with a non-toy backend.
