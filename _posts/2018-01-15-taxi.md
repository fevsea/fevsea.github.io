The final cost of a taxi trip is usually a surprise, depending on numerous factors that can not be foreseen in advance.

Although the most important are time and distance of a route, there are many others that affect in a more indirect way, such as the traffic of a determined area, the weather, the time of the day...

In this project I have the objective of predicting the final cost of a trip considering only information you can have beforehand. Since this is a learning project I'm only going to use the data of a single month: May 2016
