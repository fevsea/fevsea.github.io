I have a Jupyter Lab server where I take notes on most of the technical stuff I learn. Mostly are snippets meant to make life easy while doing projects and are not meant to be used as a reference of any kind. From time to time I take and snapshot of the content, which can be seen at the repository.

It's a good place to see what I'm interested right now.
