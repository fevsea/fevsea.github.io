This was a free course organized by IEEE BCN SB in collaboration with LinuxUPC held in 2017 and 2018. For the later edition a jupyter notebook was created with theory and problems (some material was lost during a migration).

This course was organized with two other colleagues. It had a duration of 20h (5 days).


Overall the course was organized in 4 areas:
- Python syntax and basic modules
- Software engineering concepts with python (testing, project structure, logging, debugging...)
- One day exploring interesting 3rd party libraries: Pandas (data science), python -telegram-bot and beautifull-soup (webscrapping)
- A free project day.
