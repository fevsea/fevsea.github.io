Among other activities, Linux UPC organizes a Linux install party at the beginning of the course.

As part of those activities, I took the opportunity to organize an introductory workshop for the Linux terminal so the first-year students could become familiar with the environment.

The workshop had a duration of 2 hours, where I was the speaker in 2017 and 2018 edition. Given the success in the FIB, it was also done in ETSETB.

The content, although basic, included:
- Working with files and its content
- Process management
- Bash (pipes, shell expansion)
- Networking
- Permissions

A presentations and a cheat sheet with the course content were created, and can be found at the repo [es]
